# SedBlockAssemble
Use this component to enhance your Angular applications and make them more 
engaging. Aside from the typcial Angular dependencies, this component utilises 
the [dom-to-image](https://github.com/tsayen/dom-to-image) plugin to increase 
animation performance.

Wrap your components with the `sed-block-assemble` selector and the animation 
will assemble any of your components by stacking up blocks as soon as your 
component loads.

If you have any issues or would like to contribute, please raise a 
[Github issue](https://github.com/saedwards/sed-block-assemble/issues) or a pull 
request with new changes. If you think the component doesn't quite fit your 
needs and could be improved, you're very welcome to start a discussion about 
new feature requests/changes by raising an issue.
